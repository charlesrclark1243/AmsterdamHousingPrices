I downloaded data from Kaggle and used it to create models that attempted to predict housing prices in Amsterdam. The accepted model achieved an R2 score
(coefficient of determination) of 0.736. 

The data set is not included in the files uploaded here. Please see DATA_INSTRUCTIONS.txt in the data directory for a link to the dataset's page on
Kaggle, as well as instructions for getting the code files to work correctly. Please note, the instructions provided in DATA_INSTRUCTIONS.txt file
only need to be followed if the directories included in this repository are not downloaded directly and placed in the same main working directory.
